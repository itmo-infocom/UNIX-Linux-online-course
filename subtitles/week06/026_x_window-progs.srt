1
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,150
OK.

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,490
Let's look to some classical XWindow applications.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:19,260
The first one as we know is a X server:

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,320
$ man Xserver

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,399
Most important options is:
* `:displaynumber` -- default is 0

6
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:44,660
* `-fp fontPath` -- search path for fonts
* `-s minutes` -- screen-saver timeout

7
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:51,440
which we set in minutes

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,600
And some interestng options that can help
organize a local XWindow network with low-cost

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:09,990
X terminals and application servers:
* `-query hostname` -- enables XDMCP and sends

10
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:25,710
Query packets to the specified hostname to
the application server on
which this or that display manager is running;

11
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:38,979
* `-broadcast` -- enables XDMCP and broadcasts
BroadcastQuery packets to the network.

12
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:47,580
In this way, simple load balancing between
application servers can be organized;

13
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:56,640
* `-indirect hostname` -- enables XDMCP and
send IndirectQuery packets to the specified

14
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
hostname.

15
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:07,790
In this case, you will see a list of available
application servers on your client that you can select.

16
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:20,010
After starting the X-server, it is possible
to change some parameters of this server on the fly by `xset`

17
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,010
command:

18
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,010
$ man xset

19
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,999
-display display – you may set a display

20
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:32,500
q – you may get current settings

21
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:46,680
[+|-]fp[+|-|=] path,... – you can set the font path

22
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:58,840
s – you can change screen saver parameters

23
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,400
And many others.

24
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,919
As we discussed earlier, the main principle

25
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:12,650
of the X Window System is "Provide a mechanism,
not a policy."

26
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:28,930
And the look and feel in X Window can be anything
-- it is simply determined by the set of widgets

27
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:35,299
on which a particular application is built.

28
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:42,639
It is not a paradox, but the appearance of
the original XWindow applications may seem

29
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:51,859
a little odd to modern users, as they are
based on an ancient set of widgets from the

30
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,650
Athena project.

31
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:11,019
It looks "ugly" at now days, but they were
often used in the period of X-Window history that

32
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:25,259
described as the "GUI wars", as a safe alternative
to the competing Motif and Open Look toolkits.

33
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:32,560
Let's look at the well-known for us `xterm`
application:

34
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,780
$ xterm

35
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:46,020
As we can see, these are very simple 2D graphics

36
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:54,340
with very unusual scrollbar behavior, which
often discourages new users.

37
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:04,960
The general abstraction of a mouse pointer
in an XWindow is a three-button device.

38
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:15,449
If you have a mouse with fewer buttons, the
middle button is emulated, for example, by

39
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:21,970
simultaneously pressing the left and right
buttons.

40
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:45,409
So here: pressing the left button on the scroll
bar scrolls forward, the right button backward,

41
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:53,030
and the middle button scrolls to the selected
position.

42
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,990
Yet another classic XWindow utilities:

43
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:09,740
xkill - kill a client by its X resource
xdpyinfo - display information utility for X-Window

44
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,560
xwininfo - window information utility
about selected window

45
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:25,600
xlsclients - list client applications running on display

46
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,200
and many others.

47
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:34,200
As we can see, we still support the same concept:

48
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:42,600
with the graphical application
we can work from a command line.
