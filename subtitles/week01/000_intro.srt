Hi!

3
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:13,269
My name is Oleg Sadov.

4
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:18,439
I'm going to be your instructor for this course.

5
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:26,980
I've been involved in the Unix world more
than 30 years ago and have been working with

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,320
Linux systems almost from the very beginning.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,280
This is an Unix and Linux introductory course.

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:44,670
This course isn't about memorizing countless
definitions and specifications or endlessly

9
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,480
learning how to keystroke.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:58,879
Instead, we will try to understand the philosophy
of systems and the reasons why existing technical

11
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,960
solutions were developed.

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,750
This course will provide you with a fundamentals
of Unix and Linux operating systems.

13
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:18,750
It will show you how such systems are organized,
and demonstrate how to use them at an advanced

14
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,000
level, which you will be able to practice
on your own.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,820
In addition to the usual lectures, we have added
 additional materials called "Under the Hood".

16
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:42,360
This is not required for graduation checks,
but understanding it does matter when interviewing

17
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,750
for a well-known company like Google or Facebook.

18
00:01:48,750 --> 00:02:01,130
In this course you will be introduced to reasons
why open standards and the open source development

19
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:06,570
model are so important in today's computing
environment.

20
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,000
After completing this course, you will have
a solid introduction to working with Unix/Linux

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,730
from the command line and a good understanding
of principles how these systems work.

22
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:30,220
In applying these skills, you will be able
to perform fundamental operational tasks,

23
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:38,840
whether your Unix/Linux machine is in your
hands or on a remote system across the Internet.

24
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:50,510
And you will be ready to work with any UNIX-like
system with an experienced user and move on

25
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:58,240
to learning the problems solved by the administrators,
developers or DevOps.
