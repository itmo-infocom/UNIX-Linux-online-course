1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:13,970
Initially, when computer R&D projects were
mostly just university research, they were

2
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,320
open source and free of charge as a common
scientific research result.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:32,689
In addition, scientists were very interested
in widespread dissemination of this result,

4
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:45,730
because their renommÃ©e, their reputation directly depended
on the prominence of their scientific work.

5
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:55,010
Commercialization has changed this world to
a closed and paid model.

6
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:02,440
Not completely closed, because standardization
is very important for government agencies

7
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:11,510
and corporate consumers to protect investments
and prevent vendor locking.

8
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:18,510
As a consequence, many open standards have
been created by committees and organizations:

9
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,650
POSIX, ANSI, ISO.

10
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:32,480
And openness was a serious weapon in business competition.

11
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,000
For example, some well-known companies.

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,440
including Bull, DEC, IBM, HP, Hitachi, Philips,
Siemens and others, created the 

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:56,490
Open Software Foundation (OSF) to fight SUN and AT&T during
the so-called "Unix wars".

14
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:04,070
The POSIX subsystem (which was actually just
a description of UNIX-like systems standards)

15
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:14,489
was included in Microsoft Windows NT because
in the 1980s the US federal government required

16
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:20,959
compatibility with this open standard for
government contracts.

17
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,810
This openness is very important because we
get more compatible systems from different

18
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,569
vendors, ideally without undocumented features.

19
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:37,250
As a result, we have a computing infrastructure
with higher efficiency and lower cost of ownership.

20
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:44,059
But for some people, especially in the scientific
world, this is not enough.

21
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:53,519
And in 1985, Richard Stallman from MIT published
the GNU Manifesto where he announced the GNU

22
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,049
Project.

23
00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:05,299
The main goal of this project was to create
a UNIX-like OS with a full set of UNIX utilities

24
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:08,260
from completely free software.

25
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,299
The Free Software Foundation (FSF) was formed
to support these activities.

26
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:27,000
But what is this freedom in the computer world
and how is it different from openness?

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,049
This difference is most accurately described
in licenses.

28
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:41,439
In the proprietary world, the most widely
used are so-called copyright licenses, which

29
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,870
usually restrict certain user rights.

30
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:52,290
Even with legal access to the source code,
the copyright holder can harass the consumer,

31
00:03:52,290 --> 00:04:03,939
as we saw in the USL versus BSD or SCO versus
IBM lawsuits.

32
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:04,949
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.en.html

33
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:14,479
In contrast, the free software world uses
copyleft licenses.

34
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:22,050
The most famous permissive licenses for free
software were published in the late 1980s.

35
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:36,200
Two of them, named BSD and MIT - the educational
institutions in which they were created - look

36
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:46,180
almost the same and give us the following
basic rights:

37
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:54,360
* The freedom to run the program as you wish,
for any purpose (freedom 0).

38
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:02,620
* The freedom to study how the program works,
and change it so it does your computing as

39
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,680
you wish (freedom 1).

40
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,810
Access to the source code is a precondition
for this.

41
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:18,380
* The freedom to redistribute copies so you
can help others (freedom 2).

42
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:26,580
* The freedom to distribute copies of your
modified versions to others (freedom 3).

43
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:34,640
By doing this you can give the whole community
a chance to benefit from your changes.

44
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,750
Access to the source code is a precondition
for this.

45
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:49,740
The most famous projects released under these licenses
are BSD Unix and the MIT X-Window graphics system.

46
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:59,950
Such licenses do not restrict the use of closed
derivative projects and their proprietarization.

47
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:11,740
To avoid this, the GNU General Public License
(GNU GPL or GPL) was developed.

48
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:20,150
One important limitation added to the fundamental
freedoms of this license (run, learn, share

49
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:26,320
and modify software) is the limitation for
closing.

50
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:34,940
Any derivative work must be distributed under
the same or equivalent license terms.

51
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:47,090
And the main difference between open-specification
software and truly free software is that we

52
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:55,180
actually have a de facto standard, not a de
jure standard.

53
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,240
In free and open source software, we have
working reference implementations that can

54
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,930
be used as a basis for future development
and cross-testing.

55
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:15,060
It's interesting, but this license does not
completely restrict the creation of proprietary

56
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,900
closed applications using GPL licensed software.

57
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:30,380
For example, the OS kernel or shared libraries,
simply because they are not included directly

58
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,450
in the proprietary application code.

59
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:44,990
We now have many free and open source licenses
approved by the Open Source Initiative.

60
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:52,910
Another challenge for the free and open world
is patent lawsuits.

61
00:07:52,910 --> 00:08:04,900
For example, in 2007, Microsoft threatened to sue
Linux companies like Red Hat over patent violations.

62
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:16,110
To solve this problem GPLv3 license has been
created, along with some activities such as

63
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:25,250
the Open Invention Network (OIN), which have
a defensive patent pool and community of patent

64
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:32,390
non-aggression which enables freedom of action
in Linux.
