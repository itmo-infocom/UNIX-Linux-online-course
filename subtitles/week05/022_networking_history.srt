1
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,250
From the very beginning of the development

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,969
of computer communication technologies, UNIX
has been closely associated with them.

3
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:20,900
Historically, the first worldwide network
to operate over conventional dial-up telephone

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:35,610
lines was created in the late 1970s at At&T
and called UUCP -- "UNIX to UNIX copy".

5
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:47,060
And in 1979, two students at Duke University,
Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, originated the

6
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:56,820
idea of using Bourne shell scripts to transfer
news and mail messages on a serial line UUCP

7
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:04,930
connection with nearby University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.

8
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:17,720
Following public release of the software in
1980, the mesh of UUCP hosts forwarding on

9
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:26,950
the Usenet news rapidly expanded and named
UUCPnet.

10
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:37,470
Technically, in the beginning, these could
be dial-up modems, simply attached to the

11
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:49,240
telephone tubes with suction cups which makes
connects on hundreds of bits per second speed

12
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,439
with very unstable connection.

13
00:01:52,439 --> 00:02:03,540
Even so, on this stage UNIX offered a fully
functional network with the ability to remotely

14
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,420
execute commands and transfer data over a
complex mesh network topology.

15
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:19,909
UUCP provided just two main utilities:
* uucp - system-to-system copy

16
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,290
* uux - remote command execution

17
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:33,860
It was a very simple addressing scheme with
no dynamic routing or anything similar, and

18
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:43,150
the command to do something on a remote machine
with files hosted on other machines might

19
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,650
look like this:

20
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,800
uux 'diff sys1!~user1/file1 sys2!~user2/file2
>!file.diff'

21
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,470
Fetch the two named files from system sys1

22
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:08,550
and system sys2 and execute diff putting the
result in file.diff in the current directory.

23
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:17,660
It's funny, this addressing is still supported,
for example, by the `sendmail` mail system,

24
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,160
which adds some complexity to Mail Transport Agent (MTA).

25
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:32,240
The 
development of modern networks began with

26
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:43,750
research sponsored by the military Advanced
Research Projects Agency (now DARPA) - ARPANET

27
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,080
started in the late 1960s.

28
00:03:49,080 --> 00:04:01,090
The main goal of the development was systems
that could withstand operation if network partially

29
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,360
destroyed, for example, as a result of a nuclear
war.

30
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:14,989
The main idea of the developed theoretical
model was distributed adaptive switching of

31
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,209
message blocks.

32
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:25,979
Research was carried out in some universities
and companies, and as a result, the TCP/IP

33
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:33,439
protocol was developed in the mid-70s.

34
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:45,150
Its open source implementation on BSD UNIX
in June 1989 spread it around the world and

35
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,189
made it the backbone of the Internet.

36
00:04:50,189 --> 00:05:00,199
And we now have a mature 30-year-old worldwide
network with dynamic routing, rich protocol

37
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,939
stacks, and ready-to-use applications.

38
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:16,309
The spread of this technology is now so great
that the 32-bit address space of Internet

39
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:31,620
Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is not enough now,
and we are moving to 128-bit IPv6.
