1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,080
$ git checkout Example_9
Ok.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,629
Let's delete this file -- in the next example
we already have it:

3
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:15,280
$ rm calc_ui.pot

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:35,880
$ git checkout Example_9

5
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:43,170
As we can see, we just made a translation

6
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:53,739
into Russian of the corresponding PO file
and added installation steps to the Makefile.

7
00:00:53,739 --> 00:01:03,719
Let's look at the PO file with Russian translation:

8
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:14,479
$ cat calc_ui-ru.po

9
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:30,730
First we have the metadata and then the pairs
of translation strings: `msgid` with the source

10
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,869
and `msgstr` with the translation.

11
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:42,759
This is not a best translation strategy because
some messages in one language

12
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:50,340
may have different meanings in other languages
in a different context.

13
00:01:50,340 --> 00:02:02,880
And in larger software projects like Firefox
or Open/LibreOffice, other localization engines

14
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:12,320
have been used in which each line from the
user interface has its own unique identifier

15
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,769
and translation for each one.

16
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:24,420
And to simplify and unify the translation
process, they use such complex tools as specialized

17
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,610
editors with support for the translation memory
mechanism, for ex.

18
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:40,440
But `gettext` is widely used in the UNIX-like
world, and that's enough for our purposes.

19
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,439
Let's compile and install our translation
now:

20
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,660
$ sudo make install

21
00:02:53,240 --> 00:03:07,340
As we can see, we compile our translation file

22
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:21,780
`calc_ui-ru.po` into `calc_ui-ru.mo`
and install the resulting binary localization

23
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,579
file into the LC_MESSAGES locale directory.

24
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:34,899
Let's check the result:

25
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:45,810
$ LANG=ru_RU.UTF-8 calc_ui

26
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,270
Great!

27
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,250
We have a calculator in Russian now!

28
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:03,160
Let's switch to English again:

29
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:21,360
$ LANG=en_US.UTF-8 calc_ui

30
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:29,040
In works.

31
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:49,030
For other languages, we still have the same
interface 

32
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:55,030
because we didn't translate the messages for
them:

33
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,210
$ LANG=zh_CN.UTF-8 calc_ui

34
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,650
And maybe it's a good time to translate our

35
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,600
application into your favorite language...
