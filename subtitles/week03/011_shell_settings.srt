1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,600
The shell is customizable.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:16,880
As you will see, most UNIX commands have 
very short names -- just two characters  

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,560
for the most common commands. This is 
because the developers wanted to shorten the  

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,600
printing time on TTYs, but are still very useful  

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:47,760
for the CLI work with nowadays. And we have a very 
useful tool for making shorter commands from long  

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:58,405
sentences -- it's called aliases.

7
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:11,840
Et  voila - now you only have a two letter 
command that runs the longer command.

8
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:25,840
And you can 'unalias' this: 

9
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,118
```
unalias ll 

10
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:29,520
alias
``` 

11
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:37,520
But after logging out of the shell session 
or restarting the system, all these settings  

12
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,280
and variable settings will be lost.

13
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:54,400
But you can put these settings in init files. 
These are common shell scripts where you  

14
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
may setup what you want:

15
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,440
`/etc/profile` -- system defaults

16
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Files for the first shell  

17
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,240
session that starts at login:
* for Bourne shell just .profile in home directory

18
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:22,720
* Bash: .bash_profile
* С-Shell: .login

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,760
And initialization files for secondary shells:
* /etc/bashrc -- bash resources

20
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:40,640
* .bashrc for Bash
* .cshrc for С-Shells
