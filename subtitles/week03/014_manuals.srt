1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:25,789
The easiest way to get information about the
use of a command is the -h option or --help

2
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:31,240
for GNU long options.

3
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:40,870
Also since its inception, UNIX has come with
an large set of documentation.

4
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,200
Some information is often found in 

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:01:10,720
the `/usr/doc` or `/usr/local/doc` directories
as text files.

6
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:21,880
But the cornerstone of the Unix help system
is the `man` command.

7
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:34,110
And the "man" in this case is not about gender
-- it is just an abbreviation for "manual".

8
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:46,780
Let's look to the manual about "manual".

9
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,190
The `man` command has been traditional on

10
00:01:52,190 --> 00:02:00,940
UNIX since its inception, was created in the
teletype era and still works great on all

11
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,460
types of equipment.

12
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:18,170
And in the synopsis of the `man` command,
we can see two worlds, two UNIX utility systems:

13
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,510
BSD and SYSV.

14
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,250
And at first we can see the different command
syntaxes.

15
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,540
Parts of the man page are more or less the
same:

16
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:47,640
NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTIONS, FILE, SEE ALSO,
DIAGNOSTIC, BUGS

17
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:55,700
The '-s' option with some integer parameter
of `man` command in the SYSV variant denotes

18
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:10,060
a section of real paper manuals supplied in
the old days with the OS by vendor.

19
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:18,980
For GNU/BSD flavors, use only the section
number.

20
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:30,960
Section numbers are also different, as you
can see here.

21
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,740
 The first sections in both is just user commands.

22
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,000
The second -- system calls.

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The third -- C-library functions.

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,611
And then we can see different numbers for different flavors.

25
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:12,410
Let's look for example to well known C-language
function `printf` manual page.

26
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,459
But

27
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,739
`man printf`

28
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:27,010
shows us the `man` page for the shell command,
not the C function.

29
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:33,780
To see the manual for the C-language `printf`
function, we must run:

30
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,069
man 3 printf

31
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:40,970
To view a list of printf-related manual pages,

32
00:04:40,970 --> 00:05:00,730
we must do:
* `whatis printf` -- search the `whatis` database

33
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:08,229
(created by `makewhatis` utility) for complete
words

34
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:36,240
* and `man -k` or `apropos printf` -- search the
`whatis` database for strings related to "printf".

35
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,090
The databases should be created by the `makewhatis`
program, which is usually started at night

36
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,100
by the `cron` service.

37
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:54,240
If you have a freshly installed system and
want to run any command related to the `whatis`

38
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,410
database, you posibly need to start the `makewhatis`
program manually.

39
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:08,639
OK -- let's look to real man page:

40
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:18,650
zless /usr/share/man/man1/man.1.gz

41
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:30,550
This is a `troff` format.

42
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:39,360
Troff(short for "typesetter roff") and nroff(newer
"roff") is an implementation of a text formatting

43
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:51,490
program, in traditional for UNIX systems style
-- using a plain text file with a some markup.

44
00:06:51,490 --> 00:07:01,220
It is ideologically based on the RUNOFF MIT
program, developed in 1964, and after a series

45
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:12,350
of source code losses and rewrites, a C-based
implementation was re-implemented in 1975.

46
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:21,600
Under the name Troff, it was accepted for
use on the UNIX system and, of course, into

47
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,810
the AT&T patent department.

48
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:34,660
The main advantage of this tool was portability
and the ability to generate printouts for

49
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:43,780
various devices, from a common ASCII printer
to high-quality typographic photosetters.

50
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:50,990
Creating new technologies such as PostScript
printers simply adds the appropriate output

51
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:56,760
drivers for the markup renderer.

52
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:18,270
Compared to the now better known WYSIWYG (What
You See Is What You Get) systems, such systems

53
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:26,890
have better portability between platforms
and higher typing quality.

54
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:35,229
Moreover, such systems are more focused on
the programmatic creation of printed documents

55
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:40,709
without human intervention.

56
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:49,279
Let's take a look at an example of manually
rendering of the man page that was hidden under

57
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,850
the hood of the `man` command:

58
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,480
$ zcat /usr/share/man/man1/man.1.gz | tbl \
| eqn -Tascii | nroff -man | less

59
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:06,660
It's just a programs pipeline in which we
unpack the compressed TROFF source, go through

60
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:17,639
the TROFF preprocessor for tables and math
equations, pass a `troff` variant named 'nroff'

61
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:31,790
to output a text terminal, and finally we may pass
a text to pager/viewer named 'less' .

62
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,939
What is it viewer?

63
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:41,880
In the TTY interface, the `man` command seems
like a good one -- when you run it, you get

64
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:50,450
paper manuals that you can combine into a
book, put on a shelf, and reread as needed.

65
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:59,209
On a full-screen terminal -- before, Ctrl-S
(stop)/ Ctrl-Q(repeat) was enough for viewing,

66
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:16,190
because at first the terminals were connected
at low speed (9600 bits per second for ex.),

67
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:27,860
and now, in our faster times, they use special
programs to looking something -- viewers.

68
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:35,160
And actually, when you run the `man` command,
you see just a viewer interface, in most

69
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,730
cases it is `less`.

70
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:48,630
We will discuss viewers further, but in a
nutshell, the most commonly used ot them the

71
00:10:48,630 --> 00:11:11,089
`less` handles 
standard PgUp/PgDown, Up/Down keys and exiting a program

72
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:20,459
by the 'q' key means 'quit'.

73
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,040
Well.

74
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:30,630
It looks great, but the man-sytle documentation
representation has certain limitations: it

75
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:39,099
is only a textual representation without any
useful functions invented after that time

76
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:46,259
-- for example, impossibility of using hypertext
links.

77
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:57,540
To improve it, the GNU Project has created
an information system that also works on all

78
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:12,410
types of alphanumeric terminals, but with
hypertext support -- `info` system.

79
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:20,470
For many GNU utilities, the corresponding
help files are in `info` format, and the `man`

80
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,829
pages recommend that you refer to `info`.

81
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:38,440
`Info` has its own user interface and the
best way to learn it -- simply run the

82
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,179
`info info` command.

83
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:54,639
The internal source of "info" is the text
markup files again in texinfo format.

84
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:03,920
From such files are generated text files for
viewing on terminals, or also by the TeX

85
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:11,399
typesetting system generated documentation
for printing.

86
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:25,399
TeX is another typesetting system (or "formatting
system") that was developed and mostly written

87
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,350
in 1978 by Donald Knuth.

88
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:49,829
TeX and its LaTex extension are very popular
in the scientific world as a means of typing

89
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,019
complex mathematical formulas.

90
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:54,089
OK.

91
00:13:54,089 --> 00:14:04,089
But the inability to use graphics illustrations
and any kind of multimedia context remained

92
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:06,399
relevant.

93
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:13,750
And in the past, almost every commercial UNIX
system vendor created their own help system,

94
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:22,060
which includes both hypertext support and
graphics for ex., and worked on the X Window

95
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,389
graphical System.

96
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:36,660
But now with the advent of HTML (yet another
text markup language), such reference information

97
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:46,600
began to be provided in this format directly
on the system or on WWW servers.

98
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:59,949
Often these HTML pages or print-ready PDF
versions are simply generated from some content

99
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:15,769
oriented markup such as DocBook XML.
