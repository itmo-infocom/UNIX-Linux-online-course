1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,830
Well.

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,759
Let's go back to the fifth example:

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:22,750
$ git checkout Example_5

4
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,970
$ git diff d6453c0c41548a55e3249ea8c3b788c71cb76f7 Example_5 | less

5
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:55,879
Looks too long, but let's take a closer look

6
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:09,520
-- actually added only the gdialog file:

7
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,950
This is not our development - it's just a

8
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:19,110
GTK+ graphical analogue of the `dialog` text
program.

9
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:34,889
Our changes simply add an install command
for `gdialog` if not already installed:

10
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:40,880
$ cat Makefile

11
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:55,450
and change four lines in `calc_ui`:

12
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:14,469
$ cat calc_ui

13
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:24,909
We first check for the existence of the `gdialog`

14
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:33,969
program, and if it exists on our system, we
set the DIALOG environment variable as `gdialog`,

15
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:39,780
if not, we set it as `dialog`.

16
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:48,810
And then we just replaced all the places where
the `dialog` is used with the environment

17
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,780
variable DIALOG.

18
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,160
OK.

19
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,750
Install the new version:

20
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:09,599
$ sudo make install

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and start our script again:

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:43,219
$ calc_ui

23
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:47,180
It works.

24
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:58,120
But remember, the only thing used to communicate
between the XWindow server and the client

25
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,959
is the DISPLAY environment variable:

26
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,640
$ echo $DISPLAY
:0

27
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:19,840
Let's unset it and try to run our UI again:

28
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:29,580
$ unset DISPLAY
$ calc_ui

29
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,960
Tadaam -- we've got a text interface again!

30
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:45,460
Simply because the `gdialog` script automagically
switches to the text `dialog` if we are working

31
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,460
in text mode.

32
00:04:48,460 --> 00:05:11,319
So, just reset DISPLAY 

33
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:18,739
and we get the GUI again:

34
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:25,840
$ export DISPLAY=:0
$ calc_ui
