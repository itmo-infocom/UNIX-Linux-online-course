00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,720
Let's add some networking to our design:

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,720
$ git checkout Example_6

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,450
$ git diff Example_5 Example_6

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,450
$ ls

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,919
As you can see, just two new files are calc.services

6
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:32,110
and calc.xinetd.

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:41,000
Because we'll take the easiest way -- we will
create a service for the `xinetd` superserver.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:52,199
As we remember, for this we just need a program
that reads standard input and writes to standard

9
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:53,199
output.

10
00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:04,050
And we also have such a program -- this is
our simple `calc` script!

11
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:17,920
To start our own network service, we need
to install he `xinetd` server:

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:43,400
$ sudo yum install xinetd
or in Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt install xinetd 

13
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:52,980
and create the correct configuration for the

14
00:01:52,980 --> 00:02:05,460
`xinetd` server and we have to extend our
`install` target in the Makefile:

15
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,900
$ cat Makefile

16
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:23,480
We check 
the `/etc/services` configuration file for

17
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:34,730
a `calc` service port definition and if it
doesn't exist, just add it.

18
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:58,180
As we can see, we are configuring our service
on TCP port 1234.

19
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:15,760
And finally we install calc xinetd config
file a `/etc/xinetd.d/calc`.

20
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,980
So, let's install our server configuration.

21
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:37,170
And now restart `xinetd` after installing
of our service:

22
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:50,949
$ sudo service xinetd restart

23
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:56,700
We can use `telnet` or the lighter `netcat`

24
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,399
to test our server.

25
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,540
Does not work...

26
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:33,600
Let's understand the problem -- we lookin
in the system log.

27
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:55,700
As we recall, we can find it in `/var/log/syslog`
on Debian-based Ubuntu or `/var/log/messages`

28
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,280
on RH-like systems.

29
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,553
And on any `systemd` based system we can use
`journalctl` for this.

30
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,150
Well.

31
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:16,900
We found the root of the problem: this is
another mistake of mine -- I did not change

32
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:27,699
my experimental "calc" script path to our
standard "/usr/local/bin/calc".

33
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:34,030
Let's fix it.

34
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:49,730
$ sudo vim /etc/xinetd.d/calc
...
server = /usr/local/bin/calc

35
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,000
And restart `xinetd` service:

36
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,690
$ sudo service restart xinetd

37
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:20,020
$ nc localhost 1234
2+3
5
^C

38
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,369
Great - we're in the network now!
