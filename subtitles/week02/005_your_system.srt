1
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:25,660
Historically, we had many flavors of UNIX-like
systems, and some of them are still alive today.

2
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:37,700
And most of them are opensorce and free.

3
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:47,580
The best advantage of free systems is their
availability.

4
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,080
You can download many kinds of Linux or UNIX
systems for free.

5
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,360
You can distribute such systems, downloaded
from the Internet, and use them to create

6
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,710
your own customized solutions using a huge
number of already existing components.

7
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:11,380
For example, for educational purposes we use
our own Linux distribution called NauLinux.

8
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:24,359
This title is the abbreviated title of the
Russian translation of the original Scientific

9
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,229
Linux project -- "Nauchnyi Linux".

10
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:35,670
We are adding some software packages for working
software-defined networks and quantum cryptography

11
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:44,389
emulating and are using this new distributions
to simulate various complex systems in educational

12
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:46,659
or research projects.

13
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:52,509
This distribution is free and is used by students
to create their own solutions.

14
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:58,810
Scientific Linux on which we are based is
also free.

15
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:07,829
It was created at Fermilab for use in high
energy physics and has focused from the beginning

16
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:16,860
on creating specialized flavours optimized
for the needs of laboratories and universities.

17
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:27,830
This, in turn, is based on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux (RHEL), a commercial Linux distribution

18
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,060
widely used in the industry.

19
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:38,330
You will be charged for using the binaries
for that distribution and getting support

20
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,200
from the vendor.

21
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:50,970
But the sources from this distro are still
free, and anyone can download it and rebuild

22
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,480
their own distro.

23
00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:03,010
The source of RHEL, in turn, is the Fedora
experimental project, developed by the community

24
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,720
with the support of Red Hat.

25
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:15,870
Leveraging large communities of skilled and
motivated users lowers the cost of testing,

26
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,900
development, and support for the company.

27
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:28,900
And this is an example of the profitable use
of the Free and Open Source model by a commercial

28
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,900
company.

29
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:41,770
There are many 
free BSD OS variants, currently FreeBSD, NetBSD,

30
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,320
OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD.

31
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:54,790
They all have their own specifics and their
own kernels with incompatible system calls.

32
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:04,880
This is a consequence of the fact that the
development of these systems is driven only

33
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:13,510
by communities in which disagreements arise
from time to time, and they are divided according

34
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,540
to different interests regarding the development
of systems.

35
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:36,400
On the Linux project, we still have one and
only one "benevolent dictator", Linus Torvalds.

36
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:49,680
As a result, we still have a single main kernel
development thread published on kernel.org.

37
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,650
While many other experimental Linux kernel
flavours are also being developed, not all

38
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,050
of them are accepted into the mainstream.

39
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:11,880
In turn, on the basis of this single kernel,
the development of various OS distributions

40
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:20,030
is made, often with some changes from the
distribution vendors.

41
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:26,560
The most commonly used free Linux distributions
are:

42
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:35,889
* community driven Debian project
* Ubuntu Distro based on Debian and developing

43
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:43,480
by Canonical company
* The Fedora Project on which RHEL development

44
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,000
is based
* and Centos -- another free RHEL respin

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,440
Gentoo, Arch, Alpine and many other Linux
distributions are also well known.

46
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:07,900
Many projects are focused on embedded systems,
such as BuildRoot, Bitbake, OpenWRT, OpenEmbedded

47
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,260
and others.

48
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:17,890
You can usually use them in different ways --
install on your computer (including coexistence

49
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:26,870
with other systems such as Windows, with the
ability to dual boot), boot from a live image

50
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:34,620
or network server without installing the OS
to a local hard drive, run as a container

51
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:42,040
or virtual machine on your local computer
or network cloud, etc.

52
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,910
You can find detailed information on installing
and configuring such systems in the documentation

53
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,500
of the respective projects.

54
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:04,919
Moreover, you can just use online services
to access UNIX or Linux systems, for example:

55
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,169
* https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11.html -- PDP-11
emulator with original UNIX

56
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:21,860
* https://bellard.org/jslinux -- a lot of
online Linux'es

57
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:35,100
When you log in, you will be asked for a user
and password.

58
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:41,580
Depending on your system configuration, after
logging in, you will have access to a graphical

59
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,730
interface or text console.

60
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:51,780
In both cases, you will have access to the
Shell command line interface, which we are

61
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,440
most interested in.

62
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,520
The user password is set by the `root` superuser
during installation or system configuration,

63
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:46,790
and this password can be changed by the user
himself by the command `passwd`.

64
00:08:46,790 --> 00:09:21,360
As you can see, this may not be so easy - `passwd` command
protects us from bad passwords that are easy

65
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
to crack.

66
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,970
The most common guidelines for good passwords
are:

67
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:36,330
* long, at least 8 characters long;
* includes Numbers, Symbols, Capital Letters,

68
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:43,600
and Lower-Case Letters;
* isnâ€™t a Dictionary Word or Combination

69
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,250
of Dictionary Words.

70
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:52,210
Actually now, as a recommendation, you can
often find advice to simply use a common

71
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,950
long phrase as a password.

72
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:04,560
It usually brings many more combinations,
making it difficult for hackers to crack.

73
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:15,010
But the superuser can change the password
for any user with the same command without

74
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:33,010
any restrictions.

75
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,694
That's all.
