When you are just starting professional computer science learning, you always have a question -- "What's the best way to invest time in IT training?" Paradoxically, in the ever-changing world of computer technology, where we, as Lewis Carroll said, “run as fast as we can, just to stay in place,” there is a system whose basic concepts are still the same, more than 50 years old. And the overall scope of this technology is only growing over time.

The name of this secret knowledge is Linux and UNIX. These systems are used all over the world of the Internet from smartphones to supercomputers. And in any field of human activity from the industrial or banking sector, to the most advanced scientific research, a good knowledge of these systems will be very useful to you, regardless of whether you work as a programmer, administrator or professional in any field.

This course will provide you with a fundamentals of Unix and Linux operating systems. It will show you how such systems are organized, and demonstrate how to use them at an advanced level, which you will be able to practice on your own. You will be introduced to reasons why open standards and the open source development model are so important in today's computing environment.

There are many reasons why it is valuable for you to learn Unix&Linux. If you are looking for new opportunities in IT, Unix/Linux skills are in high demand. Almost the entire infrastructure of the modern Internet, high-performance clusters, storage systems and big data processing are built on the basis of such systems. And for the administering of such infrastructures a good knowledge of UNIX/Linux is a big plus.

If you are developing applications, it's likely your application or its runtime is hosted on Unix or Linux. If you're working in the cloud, your cloud instances may be based on Linux, and your private or public cloud environment is also probably based on Linux. If you're working with mobile applications or the Internet of Things, it is also likely that the operating system of your device is based on Linux or UNIX. And, even if you are using Windows, often you'll need to interoperate with Linux or UNIX.

After completing this course, you will have a solid introduction to working with Linux/Unix from the command line and a good understanding of principles how these systems work. In applying these skills, you will be able to perform fundamental operational tasks, whether your Unix/Linux machine is in your hands or on a remote system across the Internet.

And let's ask our former students - what do you think about Linux, UNIX and Free and Open Source in general?

Wow -- it's cool! Let's learn it!
